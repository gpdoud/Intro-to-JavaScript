# Intro to JavaScript I & II

This repository holds the code used in the Intro to JavaScript I and II sessions. The last occuring on Wednesday, February 21.

## Session II

In this session, we talked about the basic types in JavaScript including numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays.

    var n1 = 123; // an integer number
    var n2 = 456.78; // a decimal number

    var s1 = "This is a string"; // a string

    var b1 = true; // a boolean; may only contain true or false
    var b2 = false; // another boolean

We also talked about programming statements like if() and while()

    if(n1 < n2) {
        console.log("n1 is less than n2");
    } else {
        console.log("n1 is NOT less than n2");
    }

    while(index < 10) {
        // do these statements
        index = index + 1; // increment index
    }
